**The ai + history collaboratory is an online forum with synchronous and asynchronous components. We meet monthly online and maintain the ai-and-history-collaboratory GitHub repository for asynchronous communication between sessions. This collaboratory is a continuation of the December 2024 marinelives-collaboratory, in terms of its focus on ai and history. Depending on how the collaboratory develops, we may identify potential collective collaboratory projects, or simply share projects of individual members of the collaboratory. The repository has both a wiki and a discussion board.**

The topic of our first online session on Tuesday, December 9th 2025 will be the conceptualisation, design and development of a Socratic research tool powered by Gemini (https://github.com/Addaci/Generative-Lives-Research-App/wiki), and its potential application within historical research.

**One of our first asynchronous discussions will be to highlight a set of "burning topics", which members would like to propose for future sessions.**
