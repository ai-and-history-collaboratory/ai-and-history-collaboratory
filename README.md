**The ai + history collaboratory is an online forum with synchronous and asynchronous components. We meet monthly online and maintain the ai-and-history-collaboratory GitHub repository for asynchronous communication between sessions. This collaboratory is a continuation of the December 2024 marinelives-collaboratory, in terms of its focus on ai and history. Depending on how the collaboratory develops, we may identify potential collective collaboratory projects, or simply share projects of individual members of the collaboratory. The repository has both a wiki and a discussion board.**

This season's AI + History collaboratory (2025/26) will run for six monthly sessions from December 2025 to May 2026, with a possible History Hackathon in June 2026 to be organised by our Collaboratory, but with a wider group of participants. I am already planning a second season (2026/27), which will run monthly from September 2026 to May 2027.

The topic of our first online session on Tuesday, December 9th 2025 was the conceptualisation, design and development of a Socratic research tool powered by Gemini (https://github.com/Addaci/Generative-Lives-Research-App/wiki), and its potential application within historical research. The topic of our second online session on Tuesday, January 20th 2026 was LLM-enabled HTR and its potential integration into historical research processes. It drew on Colin Greenstreet's Substack January 4th 2026 article (https://generativelives.substack.com/p/opening-the-ottoman-archive).

**The topic of our third online session on Tuesday, February 24th 2026 will be "Exploring the Model Context Protocol as an interface with databases and the concept of different types of document agents to work with databases which contain metadata and text".**

### HTR/NER

**LLM-enabled HTR and its integration into historical research processes**

Our discussion will focus on the Opening the Ottoman Archives use case detailed in Colin Greenstreet's recent Generative Lives article [https://generativelives.substack.com/p/opening-the-ottoman-archive]. The intention is to illustrate and discuss broader principles of LLM-enabled HTR/OCR for low and medium resource languages, but with relevance to all historical language research

* Ottoman Turkish
* Other Ottoman Empire languages [Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Armenian) as well as modern Turkish

and will briefly address batch HTR for both Ottoman Archives use case and for C17th English Admiralty Court depositions

The methodologies we will look at will include:

* HTR Skills markdown files
* GitHub repository for co-created markdown files by historical research community
* Two stage HTR (visual capture of digital transcription vs. transliteration, translation, NER, contextualised summarisation)
* Validation (statistical methods and human in loop)

The topics we will discuss will include:

* Integration of LLM-supported HTR into existing (and modified) historical research processes
* Reasons for resistance amongst historians to LLM-supported historical research methods
* Level of interest amongst ai + history collaboratory members and Ottoman Turkish/Ottoman language historians in pursuing a well-defined piece of academic research for publication as proof of concept and to encourage exploration and adoption of LLM-supported HTR methods

### FEBRUARY 2026 [PAST EVENT]

### Session 3 — Exploring MCP as an Interface with Historical Databases

**Tuesday, February 24th 2026 @ 4 pm UK time; 5 pm Paris, Berlin, Madrid; 11 am EST by ZOOM; 9 am Mountain time; 8 am Pacific time by ZOOM [This call will last one hour] | 1 hour | Zoom**

**Session goals:** Understand why MCP matters for institutional control over historical databases; see how document agents interact with structured and unstructured data; recognise that building an MCP interface for your own databases is within reach.

**I. The Problem (7 min)**
- Socratic opening: what are your concerns about connecting AI to a historical database? Leading to Dan Cohen's concept of "loose coupling" and the MCP protocol.

**II. Three Case Studies (10 min)**
- Dan Cohen's Northeastern University Library server (search infrastructure), Tom Scheinfeldt's ArchivesSpace server (AI-guided reference interview), and the MarineLives server (semantic queries and close reading). Same protocol, different design choices.

**III. Agent Taxonomy (6 min)**
- Three types of document agent derived from the case studies: Discovery Agent, Metadata Agent, and Reading Agent. What tools does each need, and what research questions can each answer?

**IV. Live Demo (22 min)**
- Part A: Connecting an off-the-shelf MCP server to MarineLives in minutes — what it can and can't do.
- Part B: The custom MarineLives MCP server — structured biographical queries, quantitative analysis, and close reading of a C17th deposition.

**V. Discussion (12 min)**
- What databases would you like to connect to? Where does institutional control become gatekeeping? How do agents, assistants, and pipelines fit together?

**VI. Wrap-up (3 min)**
- Resources for getting started; preview of Session 4 (Search and Discovery, March 2026).

### MARCH 2026 [FUTURE EVENT]

### Session 4 — Cowork for Historians: Skills, Workflows & MCP

**Tuesday, March 31st 2026 @ 4 pm UK time; 5 pm Paris, Berlin, Madrid; 11 am EST by ZOOM; 9 am Mountain time; 8 am Pacific time by ZOOM [This call will last one hour] | 1 hour | Zoom**

Details to be confirmed.

### APRIL 2026 [FUTURE EVENT]

### Simulations

**Developing historical simulations for teaching and research purposes.** 

Explore how students themselves can develop simulations, thus improving their generative-ai skills, including understanding python basics, the software development process, and the UI/UX design process etc. Members of the collaboratory to suggest ideas for simulations which are bite size and which interest them. 

**USE CASE:**
For example, I would be interested in developing a simulation to explore the writing of charter parties by scriveners and how merchants and masters and ship owners engaged in discussions and negotiations resulting in drafting of terms. I have high quality images and full transcriptions of actual charter parties from the 1620 to 1680 period. The simulation could also draw on statute and case law regarding charter parties and contracts grounded in C17th English practice.
