**The ai + history collaboratory is an online forum with synchronous and asynchronous components. We meet monthly online and maintain the ai-and-history-collaboratory GitHub repository for asynchronous communication between sessions. This collaboratory is a continuation of the December 2024 marinelives-collaboratory, in terms of its focus on ai and history. Depending on how the collaboratory develops, we may identify potential collective collaboratory projects, or simply share projects of individual members of the collaboratory. The repository has both a wiki and a discussion board.**

This season's AI + History collaboratory (2025/26) will run for six monthly sessions from December 2025 to May 2026, with a possible History Hackathon in June 2026 to be organised by our Collaboratory, but with a wider group of participants. I am already planning a second season (2026/27), which will run monthly from September 2026 to May 2027.

The topic of our first online session on Tuesday, December 9th 2025 was the conceptualisation, design and development of a Socratic research tool powered by Gemini (https://github.com/Addaci/Generative-Lives-Research-App/wiki), and its potential application within historical research. The topic of our second online session on Tuesday, January 20th 2026 was LLM-enabled HTR and its potential integration into historical research processes. It drew on Colin Greenstreet's Substack January 4th 2026 article (https://generativelives.substack.com/p/opening-the-ottoman-archive).

**The topic of our third online session on Tuesday, February 24th 2026 will be "Exploring the Model Context Protocol as an interface with databases and the concept of different types of document agents to work with databases which contain metadata and text".**

Tuesday, January 20th 2025 @ 4 pm UK time; 5 pm Paris, Berlin, Madrid; 11 am EST by ZOOM; 9 am Mountain time; 8 am Pacific time by ZOOM [This call will last two hours, with one hour reserved for discussion]

### HTR/NER

**LLM-enabled HTR and its integration into historical research processes**

Our discussion will focus on the Opening the Ottoman Archives use case detailed in Colin Greenstreet's recent Generative Lives article [https://generativelives.substack.com/p/opening-the-ottoman-archive]. The intention is to illustrate and discuss broader principles of LLM-enabled HTR/OCR for low and medium resource languages, but with relevance to all historical language research

* Ottoman Turkish
* Other Ottoman Empire languages [Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Armenian) as well as modern Turkish

and will briefly address batch HTR for both Ottoman Archives use case and for C17th English Admiralty Court depositions

The methodologies we will look at will include:

* HTR Skills markdown files
* GitHub repository for co-created markdown files by historical research community
* Two stage HTR (visual capture of digital transcription vs. transliteration, translation, NER, contextualised summarisation)
* Validation (statistical methods and human in loop)

The topics we will discuss will include:

* Integration of LLM-supported HTR into existing (and modified) historical research processes
* Reasons for resistance amongst historians to LLM-supported historical research methods
* Level of interest amongst ai + history collaboratory members and Ottoman Turkish/Ottoman language historians in pursuing a well-defined piece of academic research for publication as proof of concept and to encourage exploration and adoption of LLM-supported HTR methods

### MARCH 2026 [FUTURE EVENT]

### Search/Discovery

**Google search in ai mode, Gemini 3 Pro Preview and Google Scholar Labs as tools to assist in annotating and contextualising historical documents.** 

How might they be included in manual and/or automated research flows? 

How can forensic, carefully structured search be linked to hard to access, proprietary, firewalled databases? 

How can LLM enabled search interrogate library catalogues?

How can LLM enabled search interrogate large digital history databases like Old Bailey Online and the MarineLives Semantic Media Wiki?

### APRIL 2026 [FUTURE EVENT]

### Simulations

**Developing historical simulations for teaching and research purposes.** 

Explore how students themselves can develop simulations, thus improving their generative-ai skills, including understanding python basics, the software development process, and the UI/UX design process etc. Members of the collaboratory to suggest ideas for simulations which are bite size and which interest them. 

**USE CASE:**
For example, I would be interested in developing a simulation to explore the writing of charter parties by scriveners and how merchants and masters and ship owners engaged in discussions and negotiations resulting in drafting of terms. I have high quality images and full transcriptions of actual charter parties from the 1620 to 1680 period. The simulation could also draw on statute and case law regarding charter parties and contracts grounded in C17th English practice.
