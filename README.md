The ai + history collaboratory is an online forum with synchronous and asynchronous components. We meet monthly online and maintain the ai-and-history-collaboratory GitHub repository for asynchronous communication between sessions.

The repository has both a wiki and a discussion board.

Depending on how the collaboratory develops, we may identify potential collective collaboratory projects, or simply share projects of individual members of the collaboratory.

This collaboratory is a continuation of last the successful December 2024 marinelives-collaboratory, in terms of its focus on ai and history.

The topic of our first online session on Tuesday, December 9th 2025 will be the conceptualisation, design and development of a Socratic research tool powered by Gemini [https://github.com/Addaci/Generative-Lives-Research-App/wiki], and its potential application within historical research.

One of our first asynchronous discussions will be to highlight a set of "burning topics", which members would like to propose for future sessions.
