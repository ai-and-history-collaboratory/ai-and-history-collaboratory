# Swedish Early Modern Legal Terminology

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 17 February 2026
**Purpose:** Companion reference for the `ra-mcp-collaborative-research` skill file. Provides a controlled vocabulary of Swedish early modern legal and judicial terms with English equivalents, extracted primarily from Liliequist & Almbjär's overview of early modern court records and petitions in Sweden (c. 1400–1809).

Use this file when translating a user's research question about Swedish legal history into effective search terms for the `search_transcribed` and `search_metadata` tools.

**Important:** Many terms below are given in **modern standardised Swedish**. In archival transcriptions from the 15th–18th centuries, spelling will vary substantially (e.g. `hovrätt` → `hofrätt`, `HofRätten`; `häradsting` → `häradz ting`, `herredz ting`). When using `search_transcribed`, try both modern and period variants. Use fuzzy search (`~`) and wildcards (`*`) to catch orthographic variation.
