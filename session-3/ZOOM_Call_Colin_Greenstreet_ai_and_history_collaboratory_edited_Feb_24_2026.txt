Meeting assets for Session 3: ai-and-history-collaboratory: MCP & History Databases are ready!

Meeting summary

Key takeaways
Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables databases/archives to communicate with large language models, allowing for more effective searching and data retrieval
Three types of MCPs were identified: source-oriented (single archive), task-oriented (searching across multiple sources), and protocol-oriented (working with specific protocols like SPARQL)
Claude Cowork was demonstrated as a powerful tool for historians, with Colin offering to sponsor Pro subscriptions for collaboratory members
The group discussed creating skill files to enhance LLM interactions with archives and databases
Data scraping was identified as a potential method for historians to create their own archives from existing online resources
The Opening the Ottoman Archives initiative has gained momentum with 7 scholars now involved

Discussed topics

Introduction and Attendance

The meeting began with introductions from all participants.

Details
Colin: Introduced himself as the founder of the collaboratory, started 15 months ago
Mark Thompson: Early American historian based in Groningen, Netherlands
Maurice Brenner: Historian of 18th century Britain
Lucas Haasis: Research coordinator of the Price Papers, Gerda Henkel fellow at the German Museum
Dave Brown: Trinity College Dublin, early modern historian

Frédérick Madore: Historian working on Islam and Muslims in Francophone West Africa, developing a digital database
Gavin Beinart-Smollan: Completing PhD at NYU on Yiddish family letter writing, starting a new job as museum curator

Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview
Colin explained what MCP is and its potential applications for historians.

Details
Colin: Described MCP as "a way for a database to communicate with a large language model"
Colin: Identified three types of MCPs: source-oriented (single archive), task-oriented (searching across multiple sources), and protocol-oriented (working with specific protocols)
Colin: Demonstrated the Rijksarkivet (Swedish National Archives) MCP implementation
Mark: Explained his experience researching at the Rijksarkivet, noting how digitization has improved access but finding specific items remains challenging

Dan Cohen's Concept of Loose Coupling

Colin discussed Dan Cohen's work on library metadata and MCPs.

Details
Colin: Explained Cohen's concern about archival metadata losing context when absorbed into LLMs
Colin: Described Cohen's implementation of MCP at Northeastern Library, which allows students to query library metadata effectively
Colin: Showed how this approach provides better results than either traditional library searches or generic LLM queries

Tom Scheinfeldt's Reference Interview Approach
Colin demonstrated Scheinfeldt's approach to archival queries using an interview-style interaction.

Details
Colin: Showed Scheinfeldt's "Sorcery Reference Interview" demo that uses an interview approach based on American Library Association standards
Colin: Explained how the system interviews users to understand their research needs before formulating archive requests

Claude Cowork Demonstration
Colin demonstrated Claude Cowork's capabilities for historical research.

Details
Colin: Showed how Claude Cowork can access files in a sandbox environment
Colin: Demonstrated creating skill files that instruct Claude how to engage with archives
Colin: Explained his five-phase research methodology implemented as a skill: scoping, systematic term mapping, deep reading, triangulation, and synthesis
Colin: Showed how Claude can audit and inventory skills and create PowerPoint presentations

Rijksarkivet MCP Implementation
Colin and Mark demonstrated their implementations of the Rijksarkivet MCP.

Details
Colin: Showed his implementation using Claude Cowork with custom skill files
Mark: Demonstrated his implementation using Google Anti-Gravity, which created an HTML interface for the MCP
Mark: Noted challenges with search results not always returning expected items

Data Scraping Discussion
The group discussed the potential of data scraping for creating personal archives.

Details
Mark: Suggested historians could scrape existing online resources to create their own archives
Jacob: Shared his experience creating a custom archive for a colleague who wanted to preserve data that might not remain accessible
Maurice: Mentioned potential benefits for improving poorly structured databases like 18th Century Collections Online
Colin: Cautioned about checking API usage rules to avoid being locked out

Opening the Ottoman Archives Initiative Update
Colin provided an update on his Ottoman Archives initiative.

Details
Colin: Reported that 7 scholars are now involved in the initiative
Colin: Demonstrated an annotation viewer created with 9 hours of work in Claude Cowork
Colin: Explained his approach of funding the project himself rather than seeking grants to maintain agility

Skills Files for Historians
The group discussed creating and sharing skill files for historical research.

Details
Gavin: Suggested creating skill files to demonstrate how to construct MCP servers
Colin: Explained how skills can be applied to various tasks beyond language processing
Colin: Described his approach of creating narrow, specific skills that can be iteratively improved

Challenges
Finding archives with accessible APIs that don't require authentication or have usage limits
Understanding and implementing MCPs for those without coding experience
Dealing with poorly structured databases that could benefit from improved search capabilities
Navigating potential copyright issues when scraping data from commercial databases
